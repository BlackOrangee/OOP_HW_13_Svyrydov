 Implement a doubly linked list:
 
  Create the specified list(s).
  Print the list(s) – display the values of the elements on the screen.
  Perform the actions specified in the task.
  Display the results on the screen.
  Check if the elements of the list are ordered in non - decreasing order.
  Determine if the list contains a pair of elements(not necessarily adjacent) with the same data field values.
  Swap elements in the list – first with second, third with fourth, and so on.
  Determine if list L1 is a sublist of list L2(i.e., if list L2 contains all elements of list L1 in the same order).
